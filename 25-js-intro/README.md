## Intro to Javascript
- Invented to compete with native Desktop applications
- HTML, CSS, and JS (behavior)
- The index.html file MUST contain a script tag reference to the script.js file

### Learning a New Programming language
- How to Debug (console.log(), alert(), debugger)
- Documentation [MDN]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/))

### Difference between Ruby and JS

- General Number class (not floats)
- lots more brackets
- functions
    - lots of different ways to write functions
    - require parentheses to invoke
    - no 'end'
    - 'nested' functions; functions can be inside one another
    - functions can be held in variables
    - can call function before it's declared (hoisting)
- different ways to name variables (let, var, const)
- stricter


### Datatypes
- What types and how many?

####Primitive
- Number
- String
- Boolean (true/false)
- Null
- NaN (not a number)
- Undefined

####Something Else
- Objects
- Functions

### Pass by Value versus Pass by Reference


### Functions as Objects
- all the difference ways to write functions
- hoisting
