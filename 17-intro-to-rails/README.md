Rails was created in 2003 by David Heinemeier Hansson, while working on the code base for Basecamp, a project management tool by 37signals. David extracted Ruby on Rails and officially released it as open source code in July of 2004. Despite rapid iteration of the Rails code base throughout the years, it has stuck to three basic principles:

* Ruby Programming Language
* Model-View-Controller Architecture
* Programmer Happiness

Rails was created with the goal of increasing programmers' happiness and productivity levels. In short, with Rails you can get started with a full-stack web application by quickly creating pages, templates and even query functions.


 Rails heavily emphasizes ***"Convention over Configuration."*** This means that a programmer only needs to specify and code out the non-standard parts of a program. Even though Rails comes with its own set of tools and settings, you're certainly not limited to library of rails commands and configurations. Developers are free to configure their applications however they wish, though adopting conventions is certainly recommended.

Over the years, Rails has indeed made it easier for beginners to dive into web development and build large complex applications. Some popular websites built on Rails include Twitter (at one point), GitHub and, of course, 37signals' very own Basecamp. Although it has often been criticized for performance and bloat, Rails continues its iterations with an ever-growing developer community and a vibrant ecosystem.
